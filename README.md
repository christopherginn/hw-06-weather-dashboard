Weather Dashboard

## Description

I wanted to make a weather dashboard so I can easily see the current weather and 5-day forecast based on the city I search.

I also want the cities I search to be saved so I can easily access them again.

## Installation

For installation, this application requires 3 files to be associated together in order to work. 
index.html is coded to display the content.
style.css is coded to style element used in the index.html file.
script.js contains the code for the generate to function and return a randomly generated password to be displayed on index.html.

Place the files in the same repository on Github for easy deployment.

See below for a demo:

![Screen Capture](./images/Weather%20Dashboard.gif)

When the page loads, no weather data is displayed until a city is searched or clicked on from a previous search.

Once a city is either searched or clicked on, the current weather conditions will display in the top box along with the data. The section below that will generate the forecast for the next 5-days. 

The data is repopulate for the city that is selected.
